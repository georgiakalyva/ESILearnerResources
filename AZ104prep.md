## Module documentation

## External learning
- For folks who want to learn more about Kubernetes and how it works, this [video by Carson](https://vimeo.com/245778144/4d1d597c5e) is old but a pretty solid explanation that holds up well. He starts from basics and gets deeper and deeper as it goes on.
