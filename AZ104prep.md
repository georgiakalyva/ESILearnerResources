# AZ-104
## Labs
-[AZ-104 Labs](https://microsoftlearning.github.io/AZ-104-MicrosoftAzureAdministrator/) - this Github link will be updated continuously as the labs are improved over time. You'll need your own Azure subscription after your Azure Pass expires.

## Module documentation
- For links to relevant documentation, please view the [Study guides](https://aka.ms/ESIStudyGuides) link on my  [General Resources](https://github.com/ginnielizz/ESILearnerResources/blob/main/GeneralResources.md) page and seek the AZ-104 study guide. (The direct link target changes regularly.)
-  There is a Learn path for [Azure admin prerequisites](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/azure-administrator-prerequisites/) that might be helpful if you've got some gaps to fill in other fundamental cloud topics.

### Networking
- For filling in networking gaps, consider the [Fundamentals of computer networking](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/network-fundamentals/) path on Microsoft Learn.
- I like this [Subnet mask cheat sheet](https://cnes.com/subnets.html) because I hate trying to make my brain process CIDR notation.
- That said, you should understand the basics of CIDR notation. :) Check out [this post](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/itops-talk-blog/configuring-azure-virtual-network-subnets-with-cidr-notation/ba-p/2047809) for help.

## External learning
- For folks who want to learn more about Kubernetes and how it works, this [video by Carson](https://vimeo.com/245778144/4d1d597c5e) is old but a pretty solid explanation that holds up well. He starts from basics and gets deeper and deeper as it goes on.
