# AZ-104
## Module documentation
- For links to relevant documentation, please view the [Study guides](https://aka.ms/ESIStudyGuides) link on my  [General Resources](https://github.com/ginnielizz/ESILearnerResources/blob/main/GeneralResources.md) page and seek the AZ-104 study guide. (The direct link target changes regularly.)

- For filling in networking gaps, consider the [Fundamentals of computer networking](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/network-fundamentals/) path on Microsoft Learn. (This is part of a set of [Azure admin prerequisites](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/azure-administrator-prerequisites/) that might also be helpful if you've got some gaps to fill in other fundamental cloud topics.

## External learning
- For folks who want to learn more about Kubernetes and how it works, this [video by Carson](https://vimeo.com/245778144/4d1d597c5e) is old but a pretty solid explanation that holds up well. He starts from basics and gets deeper and deeper as it goes on.
